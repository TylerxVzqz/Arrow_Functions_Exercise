# Arrow Functions Exercise

Hello, future software developer! In this exercise, you will practice arrow functions. 🏹

As the lead engineer 👷 in the Galactic Exploration Team 🌌, your task is to program your spacecraft for various tasks using arrow functions: usage with no parameters, implicit return, implicit return with objects, and `this` in arrow functions.

Your tasks are:

1. **No Parameters: Activate Hyperdrive**: Write an arrow function named `activateHyperdrive` with no parameters that print `"Hyperdrive activated!"` to the console. Call `activateHyperdrive` to test it.
2. **Implicit Return: Scan for Lifeforms**: Create an arrow function named `scanForLife` that implicitly returns `"No lifeforms detected"` without using curly braces. Print the result of calling `scanForLife`.
3. **Implicit Return with Objects: Log Coordinates**: Write an arrow function named `currentCoordinates` that returns an object with properties `x`, `y`, and `z`, representing coordinates in space. Use implicit return. Print the returned object from `currentCoordinates`.
4. **Understanding `this`: Message from Home Base**: Inside an object named `spacecraft`, create a method named `receiveMessage` using arrow function syntax. This method should log `"Message received: "` followed by a message it receives as a parameter. Directly call `receiveMessage` within `spacecraft` and observe. Observe and explain the behavior of `this` in this context as a comment.
